Pseudoscience pertains to unsubstantiated or erroneous claims presented as scientific. This issue holds particular significance within the context of educational research studies, given that many of them operate within experimental conditions and often target specific student groups with varying backgrounds and levels of expertise in the measures under examination. The prevalent research-to-practice gap in education emphasizes the importance of ensuring that the effectiveness of instructional strategies extends to real-life scenarios. Achieving this goal necessitates collaborative efforts between educational scholars and practitioners.

In my ongoing research related to instruction and curriculum, I have focused on investigating the efficacy of evidence-based writing processes (prewriting, drafting, composing, revising, editing) and reading comprehension. In a prior research initiative, our research team conducted an in-depth analysis of writing classroom practices by exploring elements such as teachers' emphasis on teaching materials, tactics, process orientation, class management, and skill focus during specific units. This investigation also involved observing students' class behaviors and evaluating their final writing products. The overarching objective is to furnish educational practitioners with research findings aligned with best practices in the field, thereby contributing to the enhancement of instructional methodologies.
