Hi, my name is Maegan Tucker. I'm currently a PhD candidate at Caltech, under the advisement of [Dr. Aaron Ames](http://ames.caltech.edu/). My research is centered around achieving stable and user-preferred locomotion on robotic assistive devices using formal methods from both **nonlinear control theory** and **machine learning**. My research has been supported by an [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and the Caltech [RoAMS initiative](http://www.roams.caltech.edu/).

Aside from my research, I am deeply passionate about furthering DEI efforts within the robotics community. Towards this, I am involved in several Caltech DEI efforts such as [Future Ignited](https://sfp.caltech.edu/diversity-equity-and-inclusion-programs/futures-ignited), [Freshman Summer Research Institute (FSRI)](https://diversity.caltech.edu/programs-training/freshman-summer-research-institute-fsri), and [Rise Tutoring](https://www.caltechy.org/rise-tutor). If you are interested in discussing either my research or wish to become involved in DEI initiatives, please reach out at ``mtucker@caltech.edu``!
