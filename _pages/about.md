Greetings, and thank you for visiting my academic homepage! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Special Education with a concentration on Language and Literacy at <a href="https://education.msu.edu/">Michigan State University</a>, under the expert guidance of Dr. <a href="https://education.msu.edu/people/troia-gary/">Gary A. Troia</a>. In addition, I hold the position of graduate research assistant at the <a href="https://create4stem.msu.edu/">CREATE for STEM Institute</a>, where I collaborate under the mentorship of Dr. <a href="https://directory.natsci.msu.edu/Directory/Profiles/Person/100471?org=6&group=63">Kevin C. Haudek</a>.

I earned my M.A in Language Education from <a href="https://ehe.osu.edu/">Ohio State University</a> and B.A in English Linguistic from <a href="https://en.nenu.edu.cn/">Northeast Normal University</a> (ranking among the top 3 Teaching Colleges in China). As an education researcher, I deploy a diverse range of **statistical methodologies**, including qualitative, quantitative, mixed methods, alongside **artificial intelligence driven techniques** such as machine learning, natural language processing techniques, and pretrained language representation models. These approaches allow me to delve into the complexities of literacy and language development among diverse learners, including those receiving special education services, across grade levels from K to 16 education.

If you are interested in discussing my research, please reach out at ``wangheq2@msu.edu``!
