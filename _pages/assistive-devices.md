description: Research thread aimed at evaluating the efficacy of lower-body assistive devices, including the clinical realization of user-preferred locomotion on robotic assistive devices.

Ultimately, the success of robotic behaviors can only be evaluated through implementation in the real world. For example, the success of lower-body assistive devices is evaluated through their translation to clinical settings. Thus, my research aims to evaluate the other threads of my research (bipedal locomotion and human-robot interaction) in real-world scenarios, with an emphasis on translating user-customized stable locomotion to clinical settings.

My research towards evaluating lower-body assistive devices thus far has included the analysis of a clinical study evaluating the efficiacy of the Atalante exoskeleton for 12 subjects with paraplegiao ver the course of 12 sessions. Additionally, my research has studied the effect of variable assistance on the metabolic rate of Atalante users.
