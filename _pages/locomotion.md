description: Research thread aims to deepen our understanding of how K-12 students with diverse levels of literacy proficiency exhibit differential use of language. This is achieved by leveraging influential educational theories, such as Hayes' 1996 Cognitive Model of Writing and Berninger & Winn's 2006 Not-so-simple-view of writing.

The development of proficient reading and writing skill is widely recognized as an integral component of K-12 education in the United States, as it empowers individuals to attain their academic, occupational, and personal aspirations. However, the majority of young learners fail to attain mastery in the requisite writing behaviors and skills commensurate with their grade-level expectations. This discernible tendency is substantiated by <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/">NCES</a>, revealing that only 27% of twelfth-grade students demonstrated proficiency in writing, characterized by well-organized and coherent text, appropriate transitions, and diverse sentence structure.

The scrutiny of proficient literacy extends beyond K-12 education and is applicable to higher education across diverse disciplines. For example, scientific literacy encompasses an understanding of the mechanisms underlying scientific processes, a discernment of criteria defining valid evidence, and proficiency in interpreting such evidence, etc. A substantial proportion of undergraduate students lack the requisite reasoning and comprehension skills, coupled with insufficient writing proficiency, which hinders their ability to articulate ideas effectively. Consequently, this deficiency significantly impairs the overall quality of their scientific projects.

To date, my research focuses on examining learners' language use within a <a href="https://uk.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/upm-binaries/58163_Chapter_1_Gottlieb.pdf">three-level language framework</a> comprising lexical, sentential, discourse-level sophistication, accuracy, and diversity. In addition, I will investigate cognitive skills such as writing knowledge resources, motivation and affective stance, working memory, handwriting fluency and mechanical skills which have demonstrated significant impact on learners' writing performance. This holistic framework is important in delineating distinct writing behaviors and cognitive skills among learners and enabling the identification of their weakness and strengths. Such insights facilitate educators in tailoring targeted interventions, while aiding assessors in crafting evaluation frameworks that incorporate this array of factors. Positioned as a foundational element for both instruction and assessment, this research thread contributes to advancing our understanding of the intricacies inherent in the process of writing acquisition.
