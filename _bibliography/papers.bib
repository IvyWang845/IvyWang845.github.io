  abstract={Our goal in this study is to expand the limited research on writer profile using the advantageous model-based approach of latent profile analysis and independent tasks to evaluate aspects of individual knowledge, motivation, and cognitive processes that align with Hayes’ (1996) writing framework, which has received empirical support. We address three research questions. First, what latent profile are observed for late elementary writers using measures aligned with an empirically validated model of writing? Second, do student sociodemographic characteristics—namely grade, gender, race, English learner status, and special education status—influence latent profile membership? Third, how does student performance on narrative, opinion, and informative writing tasks, determined by quality of writing, vary by latent profile? A five-profile model had the best fit statistics and classified student writers as Globally Weak, At Risk, Average Motivated, Average Unmotivated, and Globally Proficient. Overall, fifth graders, female students, White students, native English speakers, and students without disabilities had greater odds of being in the Globally Proficient group of writers. For all three genres, other latent profile were significantly inversely related to the average quality of papers written by students who were classified as Globally Proficient; however, the Globally Weak and At Risk writers were not significantly different in their writing quality, and the Average Motivated and Average Unmotivated writers did not significantly differ from each other with respect to quality. These findings indicate upper elementary students exhibit distinct patterns of writing-related strengths and weaknesses that necessitate comprehensive yet differentiated instruction to address skills, knowledge, and motivation to yield desirable outcomes.}

  abstract={Student motivation to write is a pivotal factor influencing their writing achievement. However, individual motivation to write is not independent of the learning environment. It also is crucial for teachers to develop their own efficacy, knowledge, and ability in writing and writing instruction to help them utilize effective instructional methods that stimulate students' motivation to write and further promote their writing achievement. Given these considerations, we utilized a two-level hierarchical linear model to examine the relationships among student motivation, teacher personal and professional traits, teacher writing instruction, and writing achievement at student and teacher levels. Our analysis of the dataset, which included 346 fourth and fifth graders nested within 41 classrooms, found that motivation had a positive predictive effect on writing ability at both student and teacher levels. Moreover, female students, fifth graders, and typically achieving students demonstrated higher writing achievement than their counterparts. While there were no significant effects of teacher efficacy, knowledge, ability, or professional development on student writing achievement, we observed that higher frequency of classroom management practices during writing instruction had a significant negative effect on student writing achievement. Our full model revealed that the relationship between student motivation and achievement was negatively moderated by teachers' increased use of instructional practices related to process features and using writing instruction materials, but positively moderated by increased use of varied teaching tactics. Overall, our findings emphasize the importance of contextual factors in understanding the complexity of student writing achievement and draw attention to the need for effective instructional practices to support students' writing development.}

  abstract={The impact of OpenAI’s ChatGPT on education has led to a reexamination of traditional pedagogical methods and assessments. However, ChatGPT’s performance capabilities on a wide range of assessments remain to be determined. This study aims to classify ChatGPT-generated and student constructed responses to a college-level environmental science question and explore the linguistic- and content-level features that can be used to address the differential use of language. Coh-Metrix textual analytic tool was implemented to identify and extract linguistic and textual feature. Then we employed random forest feature selection method to determine the best representative and nonredundant text-based features. We also employed TF-IDF metrics to represent the content of written responses. The true performance of classification models for the responses was evaluated and compared in three scenarios: (a) using content-level features alone, (b) using linguistic-level features alone, (c) using the combination of two. The results demonstrated that the accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and F1-score all increased when we used the combination of two-level features. The results of this study hold promise to provide valuable insights for instructors to detect student responses and integrate ChatGPT into their course development. This study also highlights the significance of linguistic- and content-level features in AI education research.}

  abstract={The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the degree to which register knowledge, register-specific motivation, and diverse linguistic features are predictive of human judgment of writing quality in three registers—narrative, informative, and opinion. The secondary purpose is to compare the evaluation metrics of register-partitioned automated writing evaluation models in three conditions: (1) register-related factors alone, (2) linguistic features alone, and (3) the combination of these two. A total of 1006 essays (n = 327, 342, and 337 for informative, narrative, and opinion, respectively) written by 92 fourth- and fifth-graders were examined. A series of hierarchical linear regression analyses controlling for the effects of demographics were conducted to select the most useful features to capture text quality, scored by humans, in the three registers. These features were in turn entered into automated writing evaluation predictive models with tuning of the parameters in a tenfold cross-validation procedure. The average validity coefficients (i.e., quadratic-weighed kappa, Pearson correlation r, standardized mean score difference, score deviation analysis) were computed. The results demonstrate that (1) diverse feature sets are utilized to predict quality in the three registers, and (2) the combination of register-related factors and linguistic features increases the accuracy and validity of all human and automated scoring models, especially for the registers of informative and opinion writing. The findings from this study suggest that students’ register knowledge and register-specific motivation add additional predictive information when evaluating writing quality across registers beyond that afforded by linguistic features of the paper itself, whether using human scoring or automated evaluation. These findings have practical implications for educational practitioners and scholars in that they can help strengthen consideration of register-specific writing skills and cognitive and motivational forces that are essential components of effective writing instruction and assessment.}

  abstract={Writing is an important part of a student’s academic achievement. For children with learning disabilities, writing is critical, complex, and challenging as well. Previous research studies have shown that writing performance of most children with learning disabilities is significantly lower compared to their typically developing peers. Besides, they seldom engage in effective revising behaviors either. Researchers in the United States have conducted revising strategy instruction for those struggling writers, and the students’ overall writing performance has shown to improve significantly after receiving the strategy instruction. Being informed of the writing research in the United States will enable us to deepen understanding of the effectiveness of revising strategy instruction on the writing performance of students with learning disabilities, which will further promote writing research on conducting appropriate revising instruction for struggling writers in China.}

    abstract={Assessing students’ scientific writing skills presents a significant challenge in science education, primarily due to the subjectivity and time-consuming nature of the process. To address this challenge, we designed a novel approach that leverages both linguistic and content measures to automatically evaluate students' scientific writing skills. We conducted exploratory data analysis to identify relevant features that can be incorporated into machine-learning algorithms to enhance model accuracy and reliability. Specifically, we utilized four assessment items in undergraduate environmental science on Food-Energy-Water (FEW)nexus, all of which pertained to cause and effect science assessment. To ensure comprehensive evaluation of response features, we categorized the sub-questions of the cause and effect task into six subtypes, namely effect, tracing, system flows, predict, cause, and devise.Our primary objective is to compare how varying subtypes affect students’ writing about phenomena in FEW nexus. A mixed-method approach was employed to analyze the data. In the quantitative analysis, we extracted 29 theoretically based features from the Coh-Metrix textual analysis tool to identify differences in language use across the four subtypes. In the qualitative analysis, we employed latent topic modeling to investigate the content of students' responses and determine whether the vocabularies were consistent with the underlying topic content within each subtype. Overall, our approach offers a comprehensive evaluation of students' scientific writing, which holds promise to inform future automated evaluation of science assessments.}

    abstract={Interdisciplinary environmental programs (EPs) are increasingly popular in U.S.universities, but lack consensus about core concepts and assessments aligned to these concepts. To address this, we are developing assessments for evaluating undergraduates’
foundational knowledge in EPs and their ability to use complex systems-level concepts within the context of the Food-Energy-Water (FEW) Nexus. Specifically, we have applied a framework for developing and evaluating constructed response (CR) questions in science to create a Next
Generation Concept Inventory in EPs, along with machine learning (ML) text scoring models. Building from previous research, we identified four key activities for assessment
prompts: Explaining connections between FEW, Identifying sources of FEW, Cause & Effect of FEW usage and Tradeoffs. We developed three sets of CR items to these four activities using
different phenomena as contexts. To pilot our initial items, we collected responses from over 700 EP undergraduates across seven institutions to begin coding rubric development. We
developed a series of analytic coding rubrics to identify students’ scientific and informal ideas in CRs and how students connect scientific ideas related to FEW. Human raters have
demonstrated moderate to good levels of agreement on CRs (0.72-0.85) using these rubrics. We have used a small set of coded responses to begin development of supervised ML text
classification models. Overall, these ML models have acceptable accuracy (M= .89, SD= .08) but exhibit a wide range of other model metrics. This underscores the challenges of using ML

academic language variables that are most predictive of quality academic writing would be helpful to guide more targeted instruction.
Aims: We evaluate Grade 5 and Grade 8 students' writing (in the genre of descriptive informational writing in response to text) to determine which metrics may be the most indicative
of academic language and what role they play in dimensions of writing ability. The roles include contributions to the dimensions of writing quantity, quality, and level of narrativity
Sample: Our sample consists of informational writing samples from 285 students from Grade 5 (n = 175) and Grade 8 (n = 110) in a Midwestern State in the United States.
Methods: An individual differences design was used to compare several word and sentence level features to determine the degree to which the features signal academic language at the
beginning and end of middle school. Results: Results suggest that frequency of longer words may be the most useful measure of
academic language in informational writing and that several sentence-level metrics may challenge our current conceptualization of quality writing.
Conclusion: Results provide promising avenues for the assessment of malleable aspects of academic language in writing}

The utilization of computerized analysis for evaluating students’ contextualized constructed responses offers a potential avenue for educators to develop personalized and scalable interventions, thus supporting the teaching and learning of science consistent with contemporary calls. While prior research in artificial intelligence has demonstrated the effectiveness of algorithms, including Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), in tasks like automated classifications of constructed responses, these efforts have predominantly leaned towards text-level feature, often overlooking the exploration of conceptual ideas embedded in students’ responses from a cognitive perspective. Despite BERT’s performance in downstream tasks, challenges may arise in domain-specific tasks, particularly in establishing knowledge connections between specialized and open domains. These challenges become pronounced in small-scale and imbalanced educational datasets, where the available information for fine-tuning is frequently inadequate to capture task-specific nuances and contextual details. The primary objective of the present study is to investigate the effectiveness of the established industrial standard pretrained language model BERT, when integrated with an ontological framework aligned with our science assessment, in classifying students’ expertise levels in scientific explanation. Our findings indicate that while pretrained language models such as BERT contribute to enhanced performance in language-related tasks within educational contexts, the incorporation of identifying domain-specific terms and extracting and substituting with their associated sibling terms in sentences through ontology-based systems can further improve classification model performance. Further, we qualitatively examined student responses and found that, as expected, the ontology framework identified and substituted key domain specific terms in student responses that led to more accurate predictive scores. The study explores the practical implementation of ontology in classrooms to facilitate formative assessment and formulate instructional strategies.}

assess student learning in these programs as well as rigorous evaluation of educational practices,especially of complex synthesis concepts. This work tests a text classification machine learning model as a tool to assess student systems thinking capabilities using two questions anchored by the Food-Energy-
Water (FEW) Nexus phenomena by answering two questions (1) Can machine learning models be used to identify instructor-determined important concepts in student responses? (2) What do college students
know about the interconnections between food, energy and water, and how have students assimilated systems thinking into their constructed responses about FEW? Reported here are a broad range of model
performances across 26 text classification models associated with two different assessment items, with model accuracy ranging from 0.755 to 0.992. Expert-like responses were infrequent in our dataset
compared to responses providing simpler, incomplete explanations of the systems presented in the question. For those students moving from describing individual effects to multiple effects, their reasoning
about the mechanism behind the system indicates advanced systems thinking ability. Specifically, students exhibit higher expertise for explaining changing water usage than discussing tradeoffs for such
changing usage. This research represents one of the first attempts to assess the links between foundational, discipline-specific concepts and systems thinking ability. These text classification
approaches to scoring student FEW Nexus Constructed Responses (CR) indicate how these approaches can be used, in addition to several future research priorities for interdisciplinary, practice-based education
research. Development of further complex question items using machine learning would allow evaluation of the relationship between foundational concept understanding and integration of those concepts as well as more nuanced understanding of student comprehension of complex interdisciplinary concepts.}

Overall, the narrative, informative, and persuasive subscales of the SWAMS exhibited acceptable psychometric properties, though there were issues related to unidimensional model fit and item bias. A significant amount of unique variance in narrative, informative, and persuasive writing quality was explained by motivation for writing in each genre. Although we did not observe genre-based differences in overall motivation to write using summative scores for each subscale, there were small but significant differences between narrative and informative writing for the discrete motivational constructs of self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and task interest and value. Consistent differences favoring girls and students without special needs were observed on SWAMS scores, apparently linked with observed differences in writing performance.
