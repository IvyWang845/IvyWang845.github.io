Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a technique used for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction. It's commonly applied to high-dimensional datasets to capture the most important information while reducing the number of features. Here's a general outline of how you can perform PCA on a high-dimensional feature matrix using Python and the popular machine learning library, scikit-learn: <a href="https://github.com/IvyWang845/PCA-on-Coh-Metrix/blob/main/PCA_on_Coh_Metrix.ipynb">Code</a>
