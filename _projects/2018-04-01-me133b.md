The advancement of nationwide models for literacy intervention and instruction over the
past two decades gears pedagogical focus towards the use of data-driven assessment and
evidence-based programs (Bianco, 2010; McMaster et al, 2017). In order to promptly organize
early identification and treatment support, many educational stakeholders give a high level of
attention to improving children's learning trajectories by implementing some progress
monitoring tools such as curriculum-based measurement (Valentine et al., 2021). This course of

action is particularly important for upper elementary-aged students writing because the genre-
based writing tasks involved in the Common Core State Standards for Written Language (CCSS-
WL) become progressively more complex and challenging from fourth grade onward, as new

quality traits of writing added into writing curriculum and assessment at each grade level
(Graham, Harris, & Santangelo, 2015). In addition, some research demonstrates an evident
heterogeneity amongst students within upper elementary school level based on their performance
on different writing measures such as writing component skills and writing motivation (see Troia
et al., in prep); hence, understanding the writing progress within- and between-person can be
beneficial for educators to capture the general picture and provide differentiated instructions
(McMaster et al., 2017)

### Project Summary
The main outcome of this project is a a graphical user interface (GUI) that demonstrates the Tangent Bug algorithm for seven different environments. Several supporting codes are used in this GUI.

The motivation for this project was to implement the Tangent Bug algorithm using LIDAR data. Even though this implementation is in a simulation environment. The algorithm does not use any information about the obstacles other than their intersection points with the simulated LIDAR beams. Thus, in theory this code could be used seamlessly with hardware to obtain the same results. However, the MATLAB simulation assumes that the robot is a point robot, so the desired [x,y] coordinates of the robot are directly commanded in simulation. In practice, an additional code would be needed to translate the desired coordinates into wheel velocities.

### Project Details
The basic idea of the Tangent Bug algorithm is that it uses both motion-to-goal and boundary following behaviors to reach a desired goal. The motion-to-goal behavior is commanded as long as there is no blocking obstacle or if the blocking obstacle does not increase the heuristic distance. The heuristic distance is calculated using the following equation.

$$ h = d(x,O_i) + d(O_i,q_{goal}) $$

where $$O_i$$ is an edge point of a continuous segment of an obstacle as obtained from LIDAR data. A visual representation of these endpoints can be seen below.

</div>

Boundary following mode is commanded when the heuristic distance increases. The bug them remains in Boundary following mode until $$d_{reach} < d_{followed}$$. The value $$d_{followed}$$ is the shortest distance between the sensed boundary and the goal. The value $$d_{reach}$$ is the shortest distance between the blocking obstacle and the goal.If there is no blocking obstacle, $$d_{reach}$$ is the distance between the robot and the goal.

### Algorithmic breakdown
Motion to Goal (While the heuristic distance is decreasing or remaining the same)
1. Compute Lidar Data
2. Move toward the obstacle
3. Terminate if the goal is reached

Boundary Following (While $$d_{reach} \geq d_{followed}$$)
1. Update the Lidar data, $$d_{reach}$$, and $$d_{followed}$$
2. Terminate if a complete cycle is completed (goal is unreachable)
3. Terminate if the goal is reached  

### Example Environments
The Tangent Bug algorithm can be used with any environment. To best demonstrate this implementation of the algorithm, seven different environments were created and included as options in the GUI.
