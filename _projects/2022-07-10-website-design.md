This site was crafted using Jekyll, and I want to express my gratitude to [Maegan Tucker](https://github.com/maegant) for her fantastic [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/maegant/website-minimal-mistakes) template, which served as the foundation for this project. Her contributions have been invaluable, and I've learned a lot in the process of designing these webpages. Feel free to explore the code I have worked on using my [GitHub](https://github.com/IvyWang845/ivywang845.github.io).
