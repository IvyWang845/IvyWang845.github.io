###  Project Summary
As my final project for my doctoral class CEP982, I developed multilevel models to examine two critical questions based on research background.
1. What trajectory patterns can best represent student narrative writing quality?
2. Does word reading ability impact narrative writing quality based on four measurement points?

### Analysis Tools
Mplus and R

### Conclusion
1. No-change model can best represent students' narrative writing performance across the entire school year.
2. Word reading ability impacted narrative writing quality during four measurement points of the entire school year.
3. Additional writing-related variables will be included for further analysis.
