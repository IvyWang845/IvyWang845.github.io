1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): These are a type of deep neural network architecture designed specifically for tasks involving images. CNNs are excellent at capturing spatial hierarchies and patterns within an image.
2. Image Classification: This refers to the task of assigning a label or category to an image based on its content. For example, a CNN trained for image classification might be able to recognize and classify images of different animals, objects, or scenes.
